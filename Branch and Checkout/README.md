# Creating and checking out branches

This directory is for the introduction and instructions for creating and checking out Git branches.

Initial Instructions *(02-24-2019)*
-

1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to a git initialized directory
3. Type in `git branch dev`
4. Type in `git checkout dev`

This creates and checks out a new branch. A branch is a pointer that points to a snapshot. Using branches is an easy way to work on multiple features or sections of code without ruining a previous section.
