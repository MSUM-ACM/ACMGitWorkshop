# ACMGitWorkshop
This repository is for the ACM Git Version Control Workshop. The workshop will be demonstrated by Kyle Fiala, an MSUM Alumni and Software Engineer on February 27th and 28th, 2019.

Initial Aspects *(02-26-2019)*

#### Why does git matter?
- Git increases reliability of the following aspects:
    - Repository reliability
    - Development consistency
    - Conflict Resolution
    - Team work

By allowing developers to snapshot code Git is increasing the reliability of repositories,
consistency of development, resolution of conflicts, and team work. Git takes a lot of the mundane
work out of updating versions in a code repository. Before version control large sections of source
code were uploaded to a central repository or saved on a hard drive and had no sense of what had been
added or changed. With Git repositories know exactly what was changed by calculating the difference
between snapshots or versions. This knowledge of change helped increase development consistency by
allowing developers to see what had been added or removed from previous versions. This ability to
detect differences also allows developers to resolve conflicts in the code. These conflicts can range
from one attribute having a different name, and thus referenced under the different name, to whole file
structures being named differently. This ability to resolve conflicts created a more productive environment.
Git points out what is different and where when dealing with conflict resolution, in the past before Git
developers would have to sit down and follow through the execution and implementation to find out what
had been added or removed and address it.
 
#### How often is it used in the field?

As of today, nearly every company uses Git or some type of version control. The developers at these
companies use Git everyday, multiple times a day, in order to maintain a reliable code base and
collaborate with other developers.

* Creating a Repo
  ```
  git config user.name
  git config user.email
  ```
  ```
  git add
  ```
  ```
  git commit
  ```
  ```
  git push
  ```
  ```
  git pull
  ```
  ```
  git fetch
  ```
  ```
  git reset
  ```
  ```
  git status
  ```
  ```
  git show
  ```
  ```
  git stash
  git stash pop
  ```
  ```
  git branch
  ```
  ```
  git checkout
  ```
  ```
  git remote
  ```
* Conflict Resolution

Possibly talk briefly about other version control software like TFS?
