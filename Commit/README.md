# Committing an index

This directory is for the introduction and instructions for adding file contents to the Git index.

Initial Instructions *(01-29-2019)*
-

1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to a git initialized directory
3. Add a file and add content to it
4. Type in `git add *` to add the file contents to the index
5. Type in `git commit` to commit the changes
6. Enter a message using the terminal editor (usually some variation of vim)

This command records the changes to the repository.
`git commit` is usually performed in conjunction with `git add`.
A terminal commit is most commonly used in the form of `git commit -m [message]`.
This allows the user to bypass the terminal editor as the `[message]`
section is automatically added to the commit.
